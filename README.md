# Adol's blog

## Description

This is a hugo project where I have built my own blog.

* Clean architecture attempts to create better projects, simplifying  complexity but also make them more scalable, easily extendable, and reduce maintenance cost.
* The code should be decoupled from UI frameworks, databases, queues, data streams... etc.
* Thanks to layer differentiation, the code is more robust and testable in isolation.
* Inner layers, where your business rules reside, should not know anything about outer ones.

## Layers

* Most of the content is stored under /content folder.

## Pipeline

* For the pipeline, I use Github Actions.
