## Introduction

The moment has arrived, a new blog is starting here. It's been some time already since I have the idea to expose a small space where I can write stuff.
Well, that moment has arrived :)

## Why?

Yes, I'm just another software geek in this big world, but still I believe it is interesting to share as much as possible stuff with the community.
In this case, there's just a few details to share: the blog.

It is a simple Hugo project, making use of PaperMode theme, below you can find a couple of links.
