## Introduction

The moment has arrived, a new blog is starting here. It's been some time already since I have the idea to expose a small space where I can write stuff.
Well, that moment has arrived :)

## Why?

Yes, I'm just another software geek in this big world, but still I believe it is interesting to share as much as possible stuff with the community.
In this case, there's not much to share, this blog is a simple Hugo project making use of PaperMode theme in ProfileMode, I will leave a link with instructions easy to follow.

## Links

* Link to [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/)
* Link to [PaperMod](https://github.com/adityatelange/hugo-PaperMod)
